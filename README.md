Project thesis  
This repository contains the code used for my project thesis in biophysics and medical technology. The file training_diffusion_model.ipynb is the code used for loading and preprocessing images, and training the diffusion model. The code in Sampling_images.ipynb was used to generate new data from the trained diffusion model. quantitative_metrics.ipynb includes the code for finding quantitative metrics, such as mean pixel value, histograms, FID and MS-SSIM.  inception_score.py was used to find values for the inception_score.
